</font><font color=#FFFF00> Every Engineer wants to make his/her bot as powerful as possible, the reason why trimming bots is one of the most common tactics to enhance bots abilities. Trimming however does come at a price, by boosting one part of the bot's functions another is lowered. For example, if you use a Trimmer to raise the defense of your bot then the aggressiveness of it will be lowered. Trimmers can be purchased from general shops, but this specific Trimmer can only be built, and it has one advantage...it will increase the chances of your bot keeping aggro on whatever it's fighting, at no cost of other skills. This means an Engineer will be less likely of getting attacked leaving his/her bot to do all the fighting. The lowest version Aggression Trimmer you'll be able to assemble is QL 30, keep that in mind when buying parts. </font><font color=#009B00>

</font><font color=#FFFF00>Note: The XU-11 Serum needs to be within 60% of the QL of the Chemical Impact Injector for this combine to work. Note that the Modified Chemical Impact Injector will raise a few QLs during this process (use the Tradeskill Kit to check). </font><font color=#009B00>

The Trimmer - Increase Aggressiveness requires Mechanical Engineering and Computer Literacy to use. Also the Trimmer only works on robotic pets... not on Metaphysicist pets.
A quality level 200 Trimmer requires 751 Mechanical Engineering and 551 Computer Literacy

Note: Remember that as you upgrade your bot to a strong version, you should do the same with the Trimmer.

* May also require a small amount of Computer Literacy (less than x1.6).  </font><font color=#009B00>
