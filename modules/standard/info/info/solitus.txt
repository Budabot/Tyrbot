<header> :::::: Solitus :::::: <end>

The Solitus breed is what normally passes for "Human" in most games. It is also
the most versatile breed with no glaring strengths or weaknesses. You can't go
wrong with picking Solitus as your breed. All of your core abilities will cost
the same to raise, and most of your abilities will cap at 480 (with the notable
exception of Strength at 472).

Many folks pick Solitus for cosmetic reasons, as it is the only breed that has
the same skin tone and body build as a "normal" human. A handful of Solitus
breed-locked items exist, as well, and they tend to be well-rounded.
