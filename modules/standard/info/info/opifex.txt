This grey-skinned breed is more slender and agile than Humans. They have bonuses
to Agility and Sense (which are Light Green for them) and a penalty to Stamina
(which is Dark Blue). This makes the Opifex ideal for ranged combat, especially
Pistol Adventurers, Fixers, and Agents. They are also pretty decent Martial
Artists and Shades. Opifex gain the same amount of Health and Nano points as a Solitus per
point of Body Dev/Nano Pool, but tend to have less in each due to their racial
Ability penalties.

Most of the Opifex-only items are geared toward Agility and Sense, but these
items are few and far between.
