<header> :::::: Fixer Grid exits :::::: <end>

The Fixer Grid is accessible by all fixers (over level 40) who have completed the <a href='chatcmd:///tell <myname> aou 30'>first Fixer Grid quest</a>.

Other professions may access the Fixer Grid when teamed with a fixer (over level 100) who has completed the <a href='chatcmd:///tell <myname> aou 31'>second Fixer Grid quest</a>.

Unlike the regular Grid, the Fixer Grid is circular, has 10 levels, and has no Computer Literacy requirements to use any of the exits. Most of the levels have more than 1 exit per destination as shown below: L = Left, M = Middle, R = Right

Typically, the higher the level of the exit, the higher level mobs you will likely find in that destination, so be wary.
