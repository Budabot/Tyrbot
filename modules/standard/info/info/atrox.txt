These fellas (if that's the appropriate term, since they are genderless) are
the big workhorse breed of Anarchy Online. They receive the most Health per
point of Body Development, and have bonuses to Stamina and Strength. They make
ideal melee combatants and tanks, but their intelligence-based skills and
nanoskills suffer. Pick them if you want to be able to dish out a lot of melee
damage and take a lot of punishment. It is a good choice for the early levels,
but in the later levels you'll find yourself hurting in the nanoskill
department.

Most of the Atrox-only items are geared toward melee weaponry and strength,
including the Silken Legchopper Gloves. Certain "large" weapons are also Atrox
only, such as the Support Beams and the Diamondine Kick Pistol. Oddly enough,
because Atrox is genderless, in many cases they can wear both male and female
outfits.
