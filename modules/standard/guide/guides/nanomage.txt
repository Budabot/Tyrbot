<header> :::::: Nanomage :::::: <end>

This breed is difficult to play for most new players due to the hits they take
in the Health department and is not recommended until you have a better grasp
of the game. They have superior abilities in Nano-related skills and overall
Nanopoints, but have less Health. They have penalties in Strength and Agility.

Later on in the game, they get access to breed-only buff items such as the
Shades of Lucubration, but these items tend to be out of the grasp of a new
player anyway. It's something to think about for veteran players. Typically,
playing a Nanomage is a challenging proposition and is one way to ramp up the
difficulty of the game.
