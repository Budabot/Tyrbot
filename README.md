# Budabot (Python rewrite)

This is a rewrite of the original [Budabot](https://github.com/Budabot/Budabot) in Python3.  

Budabot is an in-game chat-bot for the MMORPG Anarchy Online released by Funcom in 2001.  

## Installation
In its current state, this project is not meant to be used, other than during development.  

If you want to test it, clone it and install its dependencies: `pip install -U -r requirements.txt`.  
Copy `conf/config.template.json` to `conf/config.json`, update its values and  either run the `start.bat` or `start.sh`.
