core changes:
allow chatblobs in message_hub
messagehub: remove formatted_message, add formatted_prefix
add !translations command
add setting to control how long to wait for login finish

module changes:
online lists split by conn?
topic/raid should be conn-specific
flatroll history
trader drain command
add data cores to apf loot  - loot lists must be updated to use item ids instead of names first since all cores have the same name
add a command to list all raid loot categories, cleanup !loot subcommands
loot lists should also work for auctions
raid log needs (main_id(eg, account_id), char_id, by_char_id, type[joined, left, kicked, added, switched_alt, points], description)
!raid start - should we get rid of points presets and have raid types instead?

ALTS - done, show warning when adding alt that has higher access level than main
LIMITS - ignore for now, add restricted_guest as an access level, just above all, for whitelisting, and let limits dictate how "all" access level chars are handled
PREFERENCES - ignore for now
PROFILE - ignore
USAGE - ignore for now, needs !usage command, needs to submit usage
BANK - ignore
IMPLANT - needs !implantdesigner
REPUTATION - ignore
